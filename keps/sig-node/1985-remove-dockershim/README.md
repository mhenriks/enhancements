## Terms

- **CRI:** Container Runtime Interface – a plugin interface which enables kubelet to use a wide variety of container 
runtimes, without the need to recompile.

## Summary

CRI for docker (i.e. dockershim) is currently a built-in container runtime in kubelet code base. This proposal aims 
at a deprecation and subsequent removal of dockershim from kubelet.

## Motivation

In Kubernetes, the CRI interface is used to talk to a container runtime, The design of CRI is to be able to run a CRI
implementation as a separate binary. However currently the CRI of docker (a.k.a. dockershim) is part of kubelet code, runs
as part of kubelet and is tightly coupled with kubelet's lifecycle. 

This is not ideal as kubelet then has dependency on specific container runtime which leads to maintenance burden for not 
only developers in sig-node, but also cluster administrators when critical issues (e.g. runc CVE) happen to container 
runtimes. The pros of removing dockershim is straightforward:

### Pros
- Docker is not special and should be just a CRI implementation just like every other CRI implementation in our ecosystem. 
- Currently, dockershim "enjoys" some inconsistent integrations for various reasons (see [legacyLogProvider](https://cs.k8s.io/?q=legacyLogProvider&i=nope&files=&repos=kubernetes/kubernetes) for example) . Removing these "features" should eliminate maintenance burden of kubelet.
- A cri-dockerd can be maintained independently by folks who are interested in keeping this functionality
- Over time we can remove vendored docker dependencies in kubelet.
- Due to convenience of inheriting from this builtin shim for the container runtime, there is less incentive to move to 
  new container runtimes. The production issues found and addressed in both Containerd and CRI-O might cause the 
  production issues for some users, which causes a lot of maintenance burdens to Kubernetes community.
- The community can focus and move faster on the new container runtime-related enhancements once we drop dockershim

Having said that, cons of removal built-in dockershim requires lots of attention:

### Cons
- Deployment pain with a new binary in addition to kubelet.
  - An additional component may aggravate the complexity currently. It may be relieved with docker version evolutions.
- The number of affected users may be large.
  - Users must change existing use experience when using Kubernetes and docker.
  - Users have to change their existing workflows to adapt to this new changes.
  - And other unrecorded stuff.
- CRI is still technically in alpha, and should graduate to GA before removing dockershim from kubelet. There 
is a [KEP 2041](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2041) for graduating the CRI API version.
- cri-dockerd will vendor kubernetes/kubernetes, that may be tough.
- cri-dockerd as an independent software running on node should be allocated enough resource to guarantee its availability.

> You can check [the discussion in sig-node mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/kubernetes-sig-node/0qVzfugYhro/l6Au216XAgAJ) for more details. 

### Goals

- A concrete dockershim removal criteria.
- A brief plan to remove dockershim spanning multiple releases.

### Non-Goals

- Refactoring or re-design of dockershim itself due to deprecation.

## Proposal

### Dockershim removal criteria

- CRI itself is alpha. So we need another KEP to graduate CRI API.
- kubelet has no dependency on dockershim/docker in its whole lifecycle. This is already done using the `dockerless` tag
- All node related features are CRI generic and have no "back door" dependency on dockershim/docker.
- Deprecate and remove, or replace all Docker-specific features.
- Reasonable benchmark result of performance degradation after moving dockershim to out-of-tree.
- E2E test framework has been updated with fully support of out-of-tree CRI container runtime.

### Dockershim removal plan

Step 1: Deprecate in-tree dockershim and decouple dockershim from kubelet.

Target releases: 1.20, 1.21

Actions:

- Mark in-tree dockershim as "maintenance mode":
  - CRI generic changes/features can continue on dockershim.
  - WIP efforts on dockershim can continue and go to complete.
  - dockershim/docker specific changes/features should be rejected.
- Deprecate the legacy features of dockershim in kubelet by providing a specific timeline. Currently, kubelet still has:
  - vendored dockershim 
  - flags that are used to configure dockershim.
  - support to get container logs when docker uses journald as the driver.
  - logic of moving docker processes to a given cgroup
- Ensure e2e/Node e2e test framework is CRI generic and test cases are independent of container runtime.
- Refactoring e2e/Node e2e test framework to include CRI for docker installation (or use other CRI container runtime).
  - Ensure cluster/node e2e are 100% CRI focused.
  - Ensure test-infra install appropriate CRI implementations in e2e machines. 
- Ensure Windows scenarios that currently depend on docker are fully supported in alternative CRI implementations

Step 2: Release kubelet without dockershim

Target releases: 1.22

Actions:
- Document and announce migration guide.
- Release harness would build kubelet with `dockerless` tag on. So the default build will not support docker out of 
the box. 
- If folks need this support, they would have to build kubelet by themselves as the code is still present in the
source tree.

Step 3: Completely remove in-tree dockershim from kubelet.

Target releases: Deprecation should be for at least a year. So the earliest possible release after that time period.

Actions:

- Delete in-tree dockershim code from kubelet after certain "grace period".

### Risks and Mitigations

The easier we make it for folks to switch to CRI implementations the lesser the risk. Another option would be for
folks for a brand new CRI implementation that targets docker. Though even this option means that folks will have to
run an extra process outside of kubelet. The worst case scenario is for us to carry on the dockershim for a couple
of more releases. 

### Test Plan

Node e2e testing will be augmented to test kubelet built with `dockerless` tag 

### Graduation Criteria

- All feedback gathered from users
- Adequate test signal quality for node e2e
- Tests are in Testgrid and linked in KEP
- Allowing time for additional user feedback and bug reports

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

Upgrade: Users should follow the migration guide before upgrading to a version of the kubelet that no longer 
includes dockershim.

Downgrade: Not applicable.

### Version Skew Strategy

Not applicable.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

_This section must be completed when targeting alpha to a release._

* **How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?**
  - [ ] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
    - Feature gate name: NONE
    - Components depending on the feature gate: kubelet
    - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime or reprovisioning
      of a node? No

* **Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?**
Yes, the kubelet will size the empty dir volume to match the precise
amount of memory the pod is able to write rather than over or undersizing.
Prior behavior is node dependent, and so pod authors had no mechanism
to control this behavior properly.

* **Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back
  the enablement)?** Yes

* **What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?**
Pods that run on that node will have memory backed volumes sized based on Linux
host default.  The sizing may not align with actual available memory for an app.

* **Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?**
No, testing behavior with the feature disabled is dependent on node operating
system configuration.  The point of this KEP is to address that coupling.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

* **How can a rollout fail? Can it impact already running workloads?**
TBD

* **What specific metrics should inform a rollback?**
None.

* **Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?**
I do not believe this is applicable.

* **Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, 
fields of API types, flags, etc.?**
  Even if applying deprecation policies, they may still surprise some users.
No.

### Monitoring Requirements

* **How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?**
Not applicable (no feature gate).

* **What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine 
the health of the service?**
This does not seem relevant to this feature.

* **What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the above SLIs?**
This does not seem relevant to this feature.

* **Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability 
of this feature?**
No.

### Dependencies

* **Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?**
No

### Scalability

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?**
No.

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?**
No

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud 
provider?**
No

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of 
the existing API objects?**
No

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any 
operations covered by [existing SLIs/SLOs]?**
No

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of 
resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?**
No

### Troubleshooting

* **How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?**
No impact.

* **What are other known failure modes?**
Not applicable.

* **What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?**
Not applicable

## Implementation History
