## Summary

Kubelet today does not respect exec probe timeouts. This is considered a bug we should fix since
the timeout value is supported in the Container Probe API. Because exec probe timeouts
were never respected by kubelet, a new feature gate `ExecProbeTimeouts` will be introduced.
With this feature, nodes can be configured to preserve the current behavior while the proper
timeouts are enabled for exec probes.

## Motivation

Kubelet not respecting the probe timeout is a bug and should be fixed.

### Goals

* treat exec probe timeouts as probe failures in kubelet

### Non-Goals

* ensuring exec processes that timed out have been killed by kubelet.
* introducing CRI errors for handling scenarios such as time outs.

## Proposal

### Risks and Mitigations

* existing workloads on Kubernetes that relied on this bug may unexpectedly see their probes timeout

## Design Details

Changes to kubelet:
* Ensure kubelet handles timeout errors and registers them as failing probes.
* Add feature gate `ExecProbeTimeouts` that is GA and on by default.
* If the feature gate `ExecProbeTimeouts` is disabled and an exec probe timeout is reached, add warning logs to inform users that exec probes are timing out.
* Re-enable existing exec liveness probe e2e test.
* Add new exec readiness probe e2e test.

### Test Plan

E2E tests:
* re-enable [existing exec liveness probe e2e test](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/ea1458550077bdf3b26ac34551a3591d280fe1f5/test/e2e/common/container_probe.go#L210-L227) that is currently being skipped
* add new exec readiness probe e2e test.

### Graduation Criteria

This is a bug fix so the feature gate will be GA and on by default from the start.

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

N/A

### Version Skew Strategy

N/A

## Implementation History

* 2020-09-08 - the KEP was merged as implementable for v1.20

## Drawbacks

* Existing workloads may depend on the fact that exec probe timeouts were never respected. Introducing
the timeout now may result in unexpected behavior for some workloads.

## Alternatives

Some alternatives that were considered:
1. Increasing the default timeout for exec probes
2. Continuing to ignore the exec probe timeout
